# About
## How to play
1. run the module — whether it be `python3 -m niko_color_puzzle`, or any other means.
2. type in your answer (such as `OOPBB`; note: you type in the first letter of the color! Not case-sensitive, either.)
3. Guess until you get it correct. Unlike one shot, there are no limitations to the number of times that you can try.
4. win!!111!!1... or lose... depending on your technique.
